# Changelog — WCC-BiH skill

## [1.0.1] — 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- `references/foundational-texts.md`: noted that **Section I (War Crimes)** was introduced by the **December 2004 amendment** (Registry for Section I established 1 December 2004), not the original 2002 Law — hence operations beginning 9 March 2005. Harmonised the *Mejakić* referral/transfer dates.

## [1.0.0] — initial release

### Added
- `SKILL.md` — entry point, verification-first discipline, institutional architecture (Law on the Court of BiH 3 July 2002, operational January 2003, **WCC officially began operations 9 March 2005**, joint OHR + ICTY initiative, international-to-national composition transition 2005-2012), source hierarchy, citation format, audit mode, sensitive contexts

- `references/citation-format.md` — four citation modes (foundational texts, WCC-BiH judgments, ICTY referral documents, ECHR jurisprudence), chamber designations (Section I for War Crimes; Appellate Division Section I), case-number formats (X-KR-XX/XX first-instance, X-KRŽ-XX/XX appellate), document types (Indictment, First-Instance Verdict / Prvostepena presuda, Second-Instance Verdict / Drugostepena presuda, Decision / Rješenje, Order / Naredba), institutional milestones timeline, BCS diacritics discipline
- `references/verification-workflow.md` — fallback ladder (sudbih.gov.ba → tuzilastvobih.gov.ba → IRMCT/ICTY → legal-tools.org → OSCE → OHR → ICTJ → BIRN BiH), **7 WCC-BiH-specific traps**: (1) 2003 vs 1976 Criminal Code temporal application (*Maktouf and Damjanović* ECHR GC 18 July 2013) ; (2) State Court Section I vs entity/cantonal courts (FBiH, RS, Brčko) ; (3) Rule 11 bis cases vs locally-initiated ; (4) Lukić and Lukić referral revoked, case tried at ICTY ; (5) international/national composition transition 2005-2012 ; (6) WCC-BiH has no time limit (still operational as of 2026) ; (7) WCC formal vs informal nomenclature

- `examples/example-verification.md` — verifying the first Rule 11 bis case (Stanković) with parallel citations to ICTY Referral Bench decision (17 May 2005) and WCC-BiH First-Instance Verdict (14 November 2006), including subsequent escape and recapture
- `examples/example-audit.md` — two audits (pre-2013 Stupar/Kravica judgment without *Maktouf* note — Trap 1; cantonal court conviction attributed to WCC-BiH — Trap 2)

### Skill scope at v1.0.0
- Covers WCC-BiH operations from establishment (9 March 2005) through fully nationalised phase to present (2026)
- Encodes the verification-first methodology with WCC-BiH-specific procedural and substantive complexities
- Specifically equips the user to handle the **Maktouf temporal-application issue** (the most important doctrinal development), the **distinction between state-level and entity-level prosecutions**, the **Rule 11 bis institutional history**, and the **international-to-national composition transition**
- Comprehensive coverage of Rule 11 bis cases (Stanković, Janković, Mejakić et al., Trbić, Rašević and Todović, plus the revoked Lukić and Lukić referral)

### Known limitations
- The WCC-BiH continues to operate as a permanent national institution; the skill will need periodic updates as new jurisprudence emerges
- Post-Maktouf *lex mitior* analysis varies case-by-case; the skill flags the issue but cannot resolve case-specific questions
- Entity-level prosecutions (FBiH cantonal courts, RS district courts, Brčko District) are **flagged as distinct** but not covered by this skill — they would warrant separate skills if/when added
- Constitutional Court of BiH decisions touching WCC-BiH proceedings are referenced but not exhaustively mapped
